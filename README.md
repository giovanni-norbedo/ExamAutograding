# Autograding

I had to complete a Python project exam at home, and the teacher initially assessed our submissions using an automated grading system (unittest). I cloned the Autograding used in class (<a href="https://github.com/sarusso/AutoGrading" target="_blank" class="underline">sarusso/Autograding</a>), after correcting a small error (<a href="https://github.com/sarusso/AutoGrading/pull/3" target="_blank" class="underline"> sarusso/AutoGrading#3</a>), and modified it so that it only tests the exam code. The program is currently hosted on AWS at <a href="http://autograding.norbedo.xyz:5000" target="_blank" class="underline">autograding.norbedo.xyz:5000</a>
